Arrays;

What are arrays? ----------------------------------------
It is a linear DS.
Stored at contiguous memory location.
Contains homogenous elements, i.e Similar elements
Access elements randomly, through index of the element.

Why array indices start at 0? -> becoz the the name of the array Ex arr contains the base address of the array,
therefore any increment to that will take the index to the next element. Ex arr[0] 0th index, arr[1] arr + 1(4 bytes ) -> 2 index
100+0, 100+1(4bytes)

What are the applications of an array? ----------------------------------------
To store the information in a linear fashion. -efficient memory utilization.
Suitable for applications that require frequent searching
